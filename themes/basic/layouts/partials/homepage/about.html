      <h2>Motivation</h2>
      <p>The idea first started during the pandemic. Like many, I was locked in my home and wanting to help. I learned a
        lot while working in the insolvency industry and came to a few BIG realizations.</p>

      <h2>Blameless</h2>
      <p>Sometimes people get into debt through no fault of their own. It could be because of a health issue, suddenly
        becoming disabled, a failed marriage, school debt, or something else, like a pandemic! </p>

      <h2>Trust</h2>
      <p>Canadian consumers are severely taken advantage of by a system that allows others to get rich off by “helping”
        them, often causing the consumer even further debt Many of the trustees can’t be trusted.</p><br />
      <p>Being in critical debt
        doesn’t just cause financial stress, but also a massive amount of emotional and mental stress. It tears people,
        partners and families apart.</p>

      <h2>Getting&nbsp;Started</h2>
      <p>So during the pandemic I put together a proof-of-concept website focused entirely on the Toronto area to see if
        it would help. It did, but with all the stimulus packages and programs it turns out there was much less need for
        it.</p>
      <p>Now however, with a recession coming and already high costs of gas, food and home heating, I thought it might
        be
        a good time to expand. </p>
