The idea first started during the pandemic. Like many, I was locked in my home and wanting to help. I learned a lot while working in the insolvency industry and came to a few **BIG** realizations.

Sometimes people get into debt through no fault of their own. It could be because of a health issue, suddenly becoming disabled, a failed marriage, school debt, or something else, like a pandemic!
Canadian consumers are severely taken advantage of by a system that allows others to get rich off by "helping" them, often causing the consumer even further debt
Many of the trustees canâ€™t be trusted.
Being in critical debt doesn't just cause financial stress, but also a massive amount of emotional and mental stress. It tears people, partners and families apart.

So during the pandemic I put together a proof-of-concept website focused entirely on the Toronto area to see if it would help. It did, but with all the stimulus packages and programs it turns out there was much less need for it.

Now however, with a recession coming and already high costs of gas, food and home heating, I thought it might be a good time to expand. So I brought on a long-time friend to help.

After a lot of research, we put this site together. I hope it helps.
